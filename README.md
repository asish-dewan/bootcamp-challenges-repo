# Coding Bootcamp Challenges Repository

This repository is where I will be storing weekly coding challenges for my bootcamp.

I will also be publishing any related mini projects.

## Challenge #1

For this challenge, we have to refactor an existing site to make it more accesible. 

My deployed website: https://asish-dewan.github.io/bootcamp-challenges-repo/

### Challenge Requirements
```markdown

# User story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
